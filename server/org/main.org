#+TITLE: Main org mode file for Phil's website

* Org mode content

This is to demonstrate how I can create some content with org mode.  I think
this will be the easiest way to write fixed style content.

Plus the ox-twbs gives a really nice sidebar that you can click.

** Code

The main reason why I want to use org mode is because of how easy it makes the
presentation of code of various languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
func main () {
    fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
#+END_SRC

** Organisation

For writing, org mode is the best.  The easy to use tree collapsing features
make structuring a document in a clear way very easy.

** ox-twbs

I really like ox-twbs.  It makes really nice looking HTML and I don't have to
commit to it since my content is kept in a source form that can be exported to
anything else.

In the future, I might like to write my own code to take an org-mode document
and render it to HTML.
